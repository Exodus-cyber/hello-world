More Practice
Hi my name is Anthony, I'm currently in a coding bootcamp taken at Bethel Tech School of Technology. 
I love tacos and kisses like Lucy  from the Lucy and Jeff show. I enjoy coding but it growing on me more and more the more
I learn. Limitless Ideas and contributions to the world can be made from learning the skill of coding. I thank the Lord Jesus who has been my guide to this point. I know it is for His plan in my life. 
Love you everyone, hope you would all get to know your Maker just I have been called to know Him.
So Now I've started a new branch to practice. Makes sense. Basically copy and save or branch and commit. Then Pull, compare, and merge back to main.
